# Lab5 - Server API platform

## CS52, 5/13/2020

In this lab, I build an express/mongodb CRUD api server to mesh with the react&redux blog frotntend, completing the "full-stack" of the blog site. I found this lab pretty easy conceptually, just had to deal with a few minor syntax issues that were a little frustrating.

Something I expected to work was that I expected my Lab4 frontend to work seamlessly with the server -however as the data was passed slightly diffferently from my own server API, I had to make some adjustments.
